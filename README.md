mrmv is a set of bash scripts enabling easy movement of files and directories from one server to another. Think of it as a way to spawn off managed rsync 
processes that log and alert you of their success or failure; a "File Movement Manager" if you will.

I built this because I often grab large files on remote servers and want to send them "efficiently" home and leave my desk or do whatever else. 
Then a notification graces me telling of the outcome and I'm all happy and stuff...yeah.

mrmv is very simple. You basically change the config file settings to your liking and make a /home/username/.mrmv file from that config.
You then run mrmv and the rest is self explanatory. It definitely makes sense to have SSH keys (pretty much a must) and a remote box that is up.

Requirements:
rsync (both local and remote)
if you want email notifications, some sort of MTA (mail transfer agent, sendmail, exim4, etc..)
hmm, some files to move?
